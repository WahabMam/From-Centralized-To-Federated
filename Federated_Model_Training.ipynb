    "# Federated Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, **Centralized_Model_Training**, we explored the limitations of centralized training, where models can struggle to generalize when certain classes or patterns are excluded from the training data. We observed that models trained under these conditions might produce incorrect predictions, highlighting the need for a more robust approach to training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the 'Centralized_Training' notebook, we have seen that three models are trained on three different datasets. When we tested the models on data that they had not seen during training, the models did not perform well, and some even had an accuracy of zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data volume and diversity are critical for training good models, but the data is often distributed. Traditional training approaches, like the one used in **Centralized_Training**, assume centralized data, making it difficult or even impossible to centralize the data due to privacy concerns, regulations, and the sheer volume of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Federated Learning (FL) is the solution to this problem. It operates on distributed data, allowing models to be trained across various devices and organizations while keeping the data localized. FL can be applied across different industries and organizational silos, providing a way to enhance model training without compromising data privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the fundamentals of federated learning and its advantages over traditional centralized training.\n",
    "2. Implement federated learning using the Flower framework.\n",
    "3. Train models on data distributed across different clients while maintaining data privacy.\n",
    "4. Evaluate the performance of the federated model and compare it with the centralized approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by setting up the necessary libraries and configurations for our federated learning experiment.\n"
